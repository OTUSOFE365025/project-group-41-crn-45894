**Business Case** 

The AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) is designed to provide a conversational interface that connects students, lecturers, administrators, and system maintainers with institutional data sources such as the LMS, registration, calendar, and email systems
AIDAP Requirements. Its purpose is to enable efficient, AI-driven access to academic and administrative information, support context-aware responses, and integrate with existing university services.

This platform improves communication, personalization, and accessibility across the institution by allowing stakeholders to:
Retrieve schedules, deadlines, and announcements through text or voice;
Manage course materials and analytics;
Administer system integrations and institutional policies; and
Maintain continuous, monitored operation of the system.

The architecture must therefore support multi-role usage, scalability, and security as defined in the requirements, ensuring compliance with institutional privacy and reliability standards.
