| **Design Purpose** | This is a greenfield design system developed for use in a university. The purpose of this project is to design a digital assistant that is capable of providing academic information through conversational AI. The goal of the design is to produce a sufficiently detailed and scalable architecture to guide the creation of the AIDAP and guarantee an easy integration into educational institutions. |
| **Primary Functional Requirements** | From the use cases presented in Deliverable 1, the following are primary drivers:<br><br>• **UC-1:** Query institution data – because it supports AIDAP’s core business of providing academic information.<br>• **UC-2:** Post announcements and notifications – because it directly supports communication and workflows between faculty and students.<br>• **UC-7:** Synchronize external data – because it addresses the most critical technical challenge of maintaining data consistency across multiple systems (see QA-7). |
| **Quality Attribute Scenarios** | The prioritized quality attributes are listed below.<br><br>**Scenario ID – Importance to Customer – Difficulty of Implementation**<br>• **QA-1 Performance** – High – High<br>• **QA-2 Availability** – High – Medium<br>• **QA-3 Scalability** – High – High<br>• **QA-4 Security** – High – High<br>• **QA-5 Modifiability** – Medium – Medium<br>• **QA-6 Usability** – Medium – Low<br><br>From this list, QA-1, QA-2, QA-3, and QA-4 are selected as architectural drivers because they are most critical to AIDAP’s success and require specific design trade-offs. |
| **Constraints** | All system constraints identified in Deliverable 1 are included as design drivers:<br><br>• **CON-1:** Institutional privacy compliance and data protection.<br>• **CON-2:** Single Sign-On authentication for secure access.<br>• **CON-3:** Cloud-native deployment with scalability based on use.<br>• **CON-4:** Standard REST/GraphQL APIs for interoperability.<br>• **CON-5:** Accessibility through both web browsers and mobile devices.<br>• **CON-6:** Continuous deployment with zero downtime.<br>• **CON-7:** The AI modules shall be implemented using Python-based machine learning frameworks, as the development team is most proficient in Python. |
| **Architectural Concerns** | All previously discussed architectural concerns in Deliverable 1 are considered drivers:<br><br>• **CRN-1:** Monitoring of system health and latency.<br>• **CRN-2:** AI performance metric logging.<br>• **CRN-3:** Role-based access control.<br>• **CRN-4:** Backup and restore procedures.<br>• **CRN-5:** Data synchronization consistency. |
